# Laboratory Testing Area [ðŸ§ª](https://kaiodcosta.github.io/kaiolab) 

Hello, welcome to the testing zone! In advance, you are warned **not to use the codes that are here**, as they may contain numerous vulnerabilities or errors that can ruin your entire project!

showing that while everything looks wonderful, it is evil and can give you a big problem!

## What's in here?

Here you can find some tests and versions of some applications or experiments that I did. They are selected by folder, so it will be easier for you to find what you want.

- [x] You can find Android apps here, where I will almost always leave the compressed file in an apk (Android Application Pack).
- [x] You can also find some functions on the website of this repository [Kaio Labs](https://kaiodcosta.github.io/kaiolab).
- [x] And you can hardly find a pdf file or a connection to an external server.

If you want to search for something specific, sometimes you will have to look it up many times.

## External Providers

Possibly, I can create a bot or something that needs hosting, ping and reports. Mounting this on a computer or even Android would be unnecessary as it is all a test!

- [x] [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@kaiodcosta): Hosting, status and terminal.
- [x] [Freshping](https://www.freshworks.com/website-monitoring/): Maintainer, status and statistics.

Showing that in order to function well as the land, we need external providers to feed our ideas.

## How to access the area?

The area is a dangerous, minimalist place and you can access it! However, you are already warned of the dangers and that, we do not give you any guarantee. Much less, we are liable for damages!
